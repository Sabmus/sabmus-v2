## Motivation

My main motivation is to get a job as a web developer. I worked a couple of years in data related positions, but I realize that it wasn't something that I'd love to learn every day, but I was constantly reading topics about web development. So I created this new portfolio for learning about NextJS.

### Why Mongo in a portfolio?

I want to create a portfolio that I can modify easily, to add projects and experience. So I created a fullstack portfolio that has mongoDB in which my projects are stored. Currently only projects can be added, because it's what I neeed at the moment.

After login in, a new link appear to admin page:
![admin nav](./public/images/adminPanelNav.PNG)

In the project panel, a list of project can be seen:
![admin project list](./public/images/projectList.PNG)

When Add project button is clicked, a form is presented to the user:
![create project form](./public/images/createProjects.PNG)

It's worth to mention that users cannot be created, only one user exists.

I could hide the login button but I want to showcase that it's not just a portfolio, but it's a web app.
